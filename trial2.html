	<p>There are millions of people I have come across in life, sometimes thousands on a daily basis.
But out of these thousands there are only a few who have left an impact or changed my life. I am always told that u get parents not by choice, but for me even if i was given a choice i wouldnâ€™t have been able to find better parents for sure. Today on this special occasion where my dearest mom took her first breath on this planet i would like to write something for her. Someone once told me that God made mothers because he could not be on Earth himself. I cannot agree more to this fact. God for me is a power that will let you fall and rise up on your own but will protect you and even help  you get back up again. My mom has done all in her power to make me who i am today and i am grateful to god for giving me such an amazing mom who can be there for me as my best friend someone with whom i can share anything with. She never lets me down and never leaves me alone on this path of life which i couldn't have traversed alone till here. She shows me the right path always and is the light when my life becomes dark. I am not saying all this just for the sake of it using fancy English words copied from the internet. Whatever i write today mom come write from inside and i am not gonna exaggerate stuff. I remember since childhood you  did everything for me and taught me a lot. Write from giving me presents on my birthday to taking me to shop, taking me out to eat food, getting me chocolates whenever you went to the market to what not. But with this you taught me how to value money and save money and not waste it on useless things. U taught me how to be down to earth and not show off even though luckily we never had any financial issues. U are the only one other than dad whom i will always trust on everything. I still remember how i was so naughty since i was a kid running all around the house jumping here and there and how u used to control me. I know how bad i can be to handle when i have my mood swings but you always handled them with a big smile on your face which i can never forget. All the trips to varanasi together the outings over there from going to the mall to just going out to eat. I can also not thank you enough for teaching me values and teaching how to respect elders and helping me gel in with anyone. I cant imagine how many flaws i had when i was a kid but you always helped me correct all of them. The best thing you taught me was how to respect girls. In this world i see many people who dont respect girls which always hurts me. U prevented me to going that wrong path. I cant thank you enough for making me participate in various extracurricular activities and helping me to shape  my personality to the person i am right now. I know i might not be even close to perfect but i cant imagine how i would have been without you. 
Lets talk about sum fun dad you  and me have done together. All those trips we have been on right from the every year trips to Mahabaleshwar, shreenathji, to the trips with friends to those with family were the best in my life. U set an example for so many people, you are the best motivator i have ever come across. U are the pillar without which my life would fall down to dust. 
You have changed me the way noone could ever i cant imagine how aggressive i was and to the person i am now. You are the punching bag on whom i can remove my frustration always without having to worry. Right from playing video games together to you bowling to me while i play cricket to the delicious food you make i dont know what not. U are can bring a smile on anyones face, you are the one who knows how to keep people bonded always.
